# WunderGroundFetchTableData
This program retrieves daily data from www.wunderground.com and saves it in a database.
I wrote this program for my father's home photovoltaic system, then I changed the weather station to publish it.
I'm learning Java, so i'm using knowledge learned at university. I will update the project when I learn new/better coding practices

MySql is needed
